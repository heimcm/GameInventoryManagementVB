# Game Inventory Management System

## Overview

This is a simple Game Inventory Management System project that I developed during my junior year of college in 2023 for a Visual Basic class. The project allows you to manage and track a collection of games, including their names, publishers, release years, whether they are sealed, and their regions (NTSC or PAL).

## Features

- **Add Games**: You can add new games to your inventory by providing their details such as name, publisher, release year, whether they are sealed, and their region.

- **Update Games**: You can update the information of existing games in your inventory.

- **Delete Games**: You can remove games from your inventory.

- **Save and Open**: The project provides functionality to save your game inventory to a text file and load it back when needed.

- **Input Validation**: Basic input validation is implemented to ensure that valid data is entered for each game.

- **Unsaved Changes Tracking**: The system tracks unsaved changes and prompts you to save before exiting if changes are present.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need Visual Studio or another VB.NET development environment. Here's how to get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your VB.NET development environment.

3. Build and run the project.

4. Start managing your game inventory!

## Usage

- Launch the application.

- Use the "Add," "Update," and "Delete" buttons to manage your game inventory.

- Use the "Save" and "Open" menu items to save and load your game data to/from a text file.

- Make sure to clear the list before opening a new file or exit if you have unsaved changes.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my Visual Basic class instructor Professor Eric Nagel for his guidance during the development of this project.
